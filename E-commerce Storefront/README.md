## E-commerce Storefront

A simple E-commerce Storefront built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This example includes product listings, a shopping cart, and basic interactions.
Features:
* Responsive product grid
* Add to cart functionality
* View cart and total price
* Remove items from cart

### How to Use:
1. Save the three files (index.html, styles.css, script.js) in the same folder.
2. Open index.html in your browser.
3. Browse products, add them to your cart, view your cart, remove items, and checkout.

### Notes:
* This is a basic static storefront. You'd integrate with a backend, database, and payment gateway for real-world applications.
* You can extend this project by adding user authentication, persistent cart storage (localStorage or server), product categories, search, filters, etc.
* You can also enhance styling and responsiveness further.

Could you contribute a more advanced version with features like backend integration, user login, or payment processing?

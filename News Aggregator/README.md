# News Aggregator

A simple News Aggregator Website built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project fetches news articles from a public API (like NewsAPI.org), displays them in a clean layout, and includes features like search and category filtering.

1. Prerequisites

- You'll need an API key from NewsAPI.org. Sign up for a free API key.
- Replace 'YOUR_NEWSAPI_KEY' with your actual API key in the code.

#### How to Use:

Download or clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/darhrmsarm03/Webdev-projects.git

Go to the directory

1. Save the files (index.html, styles.css, script.js) in the same folder.
2. Replace 'YOUR_NEWSAPI_KEY' with your actual NewsAPI.org API key in script.js.
3. Open index.html in your browser.
4. Click category buttons or use the search box to fetch news articles.

#### Notes:

- The free NewsAPI key has rate limits; for production or heavy use, consider upgrading or hosting your news data.
- You can extend this by adding pagination, saving favorites, or more filters.
- Styling can be further customized for a better look.

You can contribute to integrating more features or deploying this online.
